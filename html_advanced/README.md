Welcome to the HTML Webpage Implementation project! In this project, we will focus on implementing a webpage based on a designer file, using pure HTML semantic structure.

The objective of this project is to convert a designer file, typically provided in formats like PSD (Photoshop), Sketch, or XD (Adobe XD), into an HTML webpage. The emphasis will be on creating a clean, well-structured, and semantic HTML layout that accurately represents the design and its content.
